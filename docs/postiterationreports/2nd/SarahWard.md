##How time was spent
Most of the time in this iteration was spent implimenting user stories. Two user stories that took alot of time was inserting new documents (because information had to be added to the database in the correct order) and the use of the table of accredited journals (because the formats of the tables were problamatic).

##What was valuable
The most valuable thing was implimenting atomic insertions to the database. This was helpful because it allowed detection of errors when attempting to insert and practised good programming practise.

##What could have been done better
Much too much time was spent on the accreditation of publications. In addition this process could be improved since the csv's containing the information need to be manually formatted (to remove the big merged headings)

###General Sentiment
As expected a huge amount of work was required to acheive all the required functionality. Although this was tiring, the end result was very satisfying.
