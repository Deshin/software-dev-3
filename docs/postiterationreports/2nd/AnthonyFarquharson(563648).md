##How time was spent
The time from the first iteration was spent with two work periods a week. The rate of completion was steady but not fast enough in order complete the use cases necessary for the second submission.

In order to account for the slow rate of work completed the last few days before the deadline were a rush to get use cases completed. This ended in switching partners to complete different client-server interactions, which caused some issues for productivity.

##What was valuable
The well designed use cases and RESTful endpoints allowed for rapid deployment of some use cases. Having the ability to refer to the documentation sheets from first iteration was incredibly valuable.

##What could have been done better
Some time estimates of the design were under scoped, and when it came to deployment they took much more work than anticipated. This delayed the entire time line before completion.

###General Sentiment
Most of the required functionality was implemented and works exactly as required. Unfortunately due to the massive scope of the project and limited amounts of available time to work on it, some cuts had to be made to the final design. The final design was not as we pictured it with all the functionality we wanted, but it did have enough that we deemed it acceptable.
