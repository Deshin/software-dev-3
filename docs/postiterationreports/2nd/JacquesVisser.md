##How time was spent
Work became progressively more chaotic as time went on. There was no structured leadership and this led to a lot of code being refactored so it would mesh well with others. After groups were briefly rearranged, and then reformed, work continued more systematically, building rather rapidly on the code-base that had been produced.

Towards the end this process became rather panicky, which reduced the effectiveness of the group significantly.

##What was valuable
Working in pairs with one person focussing on the front-end and the other the back proved to be very useful. Use-cases and user-stories that had implications in both the back and front end could be effectively handled, which might have sped up the development process.

##What could have been done better
Implementing the "advanced search" functionality took much longer than expected. This was also the case with the "upload functinoality". These tasks could maybe have been approached more effectively in a form other than use-cases or user-stories

###General Sentiment
The prodoctivity of the group was staggering in the few days prior to submission. Although, this took a massive toll on the group members. This project could have been more elegantly completed if the work intensity was evened out more.
