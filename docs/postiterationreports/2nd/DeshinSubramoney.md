##How time was spent
For the most part of the iteration, work was done at a steady rate with 2 work periods each week. However, as the deadline approached, the group noticed that the work was not being completed at the necessary rate. This resulted in the last few days being a sprint to complete as much functionality as possible.

A side-effect of this was that the pairs were rearranged repeatedly during the sprint period depending on the task to be completed.

##What was valuable
The system design and structure allowed changes to be made relatively easily with minimal boilerplate code. 

##What could have been done better
The time estimates of the "upload" and "advanced search" tasks were far off and caused the rest of the groups timelines to be delayed due to both pairs working on the single case.

###General Sentiment
While the amount of functionality generated was impressive, it was at the expense of detailed documentation and rigid structuring. One of the main disadvantages of the project was that all four of us were unfamiliar with the languages and/or libraries being used. This resulted in wildly varying accuracy in the time estimates for our tasks. If the project were to be reattempted, i think the knowledge gained during this process would allow us to perform significantly more effectively than we had.
