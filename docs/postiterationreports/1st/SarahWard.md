##How time was spent
Most of the time for this iteration was spent planning, generating documentation (user stories etc), and designing the database. A meeting was held with Dr. Levitt, who represented the client for our system (primarily as a registered user). Finally, during the remaining time, one use case was completed by each of the pairs.

##What was valuable
Learning how to design a third normal form database was very helpful. Its value was proved later in coding as it made retrievals to the database easier and less prone to error.

##What could have been done better
Too much time was taken in generating and finalising the use cases and stories. IN addition a huge amount of time was taken in designing the database. This caused us to not achieve much actual progress (in terms of user stories and cases) during this iteration and only one of the 2 user stories assigned to each pair was actually completed.

###General Sentiment
The system is probably overscoped and although it should work nicely it will need alot of work to be completed by the deadline.
