##How time was spent
Most of the time for this iteration was spent generating the documentation for the system. A database layout was created and revised first. Thereafter use cases and stories were generated and elaborated on. A meeting was held with Dr. Levitt, who represented the client for our system. Finally, during the remaining time, one use case was completed by each of the pairs.

##What was valuable
The database design was incredibly useful in shaping how we built our RESTful endpoints and thus our whole system

##What could have been done better
Too much time was taken in generating and finalising the use cases and stories. This caused us to not achieve much actual progress during this iteration and only one of the 2 user stories assigned to each pair was actually completed.

###General Sentiment
The system is probably overdesigned and will need some sever work to be completed by the deadline.
