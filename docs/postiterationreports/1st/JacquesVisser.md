##How time was spent
The first iteration was mostly converned with planning the implementation of the system. Initially, due to the system being based around that, planning was done on the structue of the database. Using this as a springboard, user-stories and use cases were drawn up on physical paper. Dr. Levitt agreed to play the role of the client for this project. A meeting was held with the client. Finally, two use-cases were completed, one by each pair.

##What was valuable
It was decided to implement a REST API. The RESTful endpoints were largely directed by the structure of the database and decisions made regarding the hierarchy of user-accounts.

##What could have been done better
A lot of time was spent on formulating user-stories and use-cases. While these proved useful as a groundwork for further activities, time could be more wisely spent on starting implementing them earlier.

###General Sentiment
The system is well designed, but implementing it seems daunting. A lot of work still needs to be done...
