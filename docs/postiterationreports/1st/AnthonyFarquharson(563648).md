##How time was spent
We spent a lot of time on the fist iteration doing design work. A lot of discussion was made on the user cases and user stories. Once they were complete a full database layout was designed for starting the development work.

##What was valuable
Having a complete database design was invaluable in designing the RESTful endpoints and the front end layout. Having a RESTful endpoint allowed for quite rapid deployment of frontend code.

##What could have been done better
Spending so much time on the user cases and user stories inhibited the amount of work that could be completed for first iteration. In the end we only completed 2 user stories per pair for first iteration.

###General Sentiment
The system is very well defined, but with all the planned functionality there was not enough time to implement all of what was needed for first iteration.
