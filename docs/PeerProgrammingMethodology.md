#Peer Programming Methodology

Use cases/stories are assigned to pairs of developers. These developers develop fuctionality in tandem. Separation is done on frontend vs. backend. This results in one developer from each pair primarily coding in JavaScript/HTML while the other codes in Python.

###Pairs:
- AS: 
	Anthony Farquarson: Frontend,
	Sarah Ward: Backend
- DS:
	Deshin Subramoney: Frontend,
	Jacques Visser: Backend

###Peer Reviews
Peer reviews are done by the other member of the pair, however correctional changes are performed by the primary committer as each member is specialised in different languages as specified above.
