The style of all code regardless of which team memeber wrote it should abide by the following guidelines:

1)Classes and scripts are named using capital camel case
2)Functions and variables are named using lower camel case
3)Object Oriented Programming is to be implimented whenever possible
4)Separation of concerns (layer separation) is to be implimented whenever possible
5)Restful practices are to be used when passing information via the server
6)Global variables and magic numbers are to be avoided unless there is a justification for them (e.g. universal constants)
7)For all python scripts the #include statments must be at the start of the script
8)For all scripts(but especially javascript) all inline functions should be short enough to be viewed in one line on a normal computer screen
9)Class objects should not be created in the constructor of another class. Instead these objects should be passed into classes as arguements
